                          Hook Any Text

  What is it?

  -----------
  HAT is a plugin for Cheat Engine that automatically converts
  hexadecimal data into readable strings. This project aims at
  providing a way to hook text when other widely used text hookers
  fail to do so, particularly for emulated games.


  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Hook Any Text
  project page under https://mx-futhark.github.io/hook-any-text.


  Licensing
  ---------

  Please read LICENSE.txt.


  Installation
  ------------

  1. Make sure that a version of Cheat Engine (6.2 or over) is
     installed on your computer.

  2. Make sure that Java (7 or over) is installed on your computer.

  3. Copy/Paste selectionConverter.lua and HexToString.jar in the

  User Manual
  -----------

  The instructions below assume a certain level of ease with
  Cheat Engine. For more detailed instructions, please visit the wiki
  of the project at https://github.com/MX-Futhark/hook-any-text/wiki.

  1. Open the game.

  2. Open Cheat Engine.

  3. Attach CE to the process of the game.
     If you are using an emulator, make sure memory mapping is enabled.

  4. Copy part of the dialog of the game manually and convert the
     string in hexadecimal using the same encoding as the game.

  5. Pause the game if you are using an emulator.

  6. Scan the process for an array of byte, copying the hexadecimal
     string you obtained at step 4 in the "value" text box.

  7. Unpause the game if you paused it.

  8. Browse the memory region of a fitting address in the result list.

  9. Select the part of the hexadecimal data you wish to convert.

  Once this is done, just play the game. New strings will be put in
  the clipboard.
